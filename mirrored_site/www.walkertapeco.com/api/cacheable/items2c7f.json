Apply Max Hold Sport or Scalp Protector to the scalp to enhance the tape’s bond strength and shield against skin irritation. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Contours </strong></p><p>Peel off the color liner that is scored down the middle. Place the adhesive side toward the unit. Avoid touching the adhesive. Place the tape contour where desired on the hair system. Repeat as needed. When ready to apply to the scalp, peel off the remaining white liner pieces. For easier application, spray Just-Rite Positioning Spray over the adhesive area. The amount sprayed will determine the amount of time available to adjust the unit (the more you spray, the longer you have until the adhesive grabs). Press the hair system firmly onto the scalp, taking care not to move it in the process.</p>","urlcomponent":"Natural-Hold-A-Contour-36pc-Bag","custitem_ns_ib_show_badges":false}],"facets":[{"id":"category","values":[]},{"id":"commercecategoryname","values":[{"url":"1522 Clear"},{"url":"Base Tape"},{"url":"Duo-Elite"},{"url":"Duo-Pro"},{"url":"Duo-Tac"},{"url":"Extenda-Bond Plus"},{"url":"German Brown"},{"url":"Lace Front"},{"url":"Lace Front Thin"},{"url":"Natural Hold"},{"url":"No-Shine"},{"url":"Pro-Flex II"},{"url":"Sensi-Tak"},{"url":"Super Stick"},{"url":"This Side To Base"},{"url":"Ultra Hold"},{"url":"Ultra Hold Tape"},{"url":"Walker Signature Sensi-Tak Select"},{"url":"Walker Signature Tape"}]},{"id":"custitem1","url":"custitem1","values":[{"url":"Bulk-Bags","label":"Bulk Bags"},{"url":"Contours","label":"Contours"},{"url":"Minis","label":"Minis"},{"url":"Rolls","label":"Rolls"},{"url":"Straight-Strips","label":"Straight Strips"}]},{"id":"onlinecustomerprice","url":"pricelevel5","values":[{"url":"1.56","label":"1.56"},{"url":"1.81","label":"1.81"},{"url":"1.92","label":"1.92"},{"url":"2.01","label":"2.01"},{"url":"4.62","label":"4.62"},{"url":"6.21","label":"6.21"},{"url":"6.97","label":"6.97"},{"url":"11.07","label":"11.07"},{"url":"14.97","label":"14.97"},{"url":"17.84","label":"17.84"},{"url":"52.85","label":"52.85"}],"min":1.56,"max":52.85,"ranges":[]}],"corrections":[],"locale":{"country":"US","language":"en","currency":"USD","region":3},"backendType":"OS","backend":"E","links":[],"volatility":"unique","code":200,"warnings":{}}
