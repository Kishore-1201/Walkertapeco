It is made to quickly remove hard bond adhesives in case of misapplication on the skin or system. Hard Bond Remover is for emergency use only and is not intended for full system removal, removing systems once glue has dried. Only for immediate mistakes, misapplications, and emergencies.\r\n\r\nIt must be used right away, not after the hard bond glue has dried. This does not work as a unit remover and will damage the hair system if used this way.","itemimages_detail":{"urls":[{"altimagetext":"","url":"https://www.walkertapeco.com/Item Images/WK-HBRM-CP-04OZ_00.jpg"}]},"onlinecustomerprice_detail":{"onlinecustomerprice_formatted":"$10.74","onlinecustomerprice":10.74},"internalid":1005,"showoutofstockmessage":false,"outofstockbehavior":"Allow back orders with no out-of-stock message","itemtype":"Assembly","featureddescription":"Flammable – Do not store or use near heat, sparks, or open flame.\r\nUse in a well-ventilated area.\r\nClose lid tightly.\r\nDo not apply to broken, cut, or irritated skin.\r\nExternal use only, do not ingest.\r\nAvoid eye contact.\r\nKeep out of reach of children.\r\nTest on a small area before use.\r\nStore in a well-ventilated, cool, dark, dry, room-temperature controlled environment (60-80°F).\r\nContains acetone.\r\nIf swallowed, seek medical attention.","quantityavailable":3.0,"outofstockmessage":"","custitem1":"Hard Bond","displayname":"Hard Bond Remover - 4 fl oz, Drip-Top","storedisplayname2":"Hard Bond Remover - 4 fl oz, Drip-Top","custitem_ns_ib_badges":"Flammable Banner","relateditemsdescription":"","storedescription":"Apply the remover and saturate the area where hard bond has been applied.\r\n\r\nNot intended for full system removal, removing systems once glue has dried.
